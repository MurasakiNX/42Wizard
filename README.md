# 42Wizard

**42Wizard** is a Discord BOT developed for 42 students at Paris. It helps students to check user connections (lock) and sends notifications via Discord (and mail if enabled) when they are about to be deloggable. 

## Functionnalities

- **Connections lookup** : 42Wizard can detect when a student has clicked the lock button or if he is relogged.
- **Notifications** : 42Wizard sends a message to a student 5 minutes via Discord (and mail if enabled) before he is able to be delogged. If you have been delogged by another student, you will be notified.
- **Leaderboard system**: You can see who are the students that delog the most and who are they who got delogged the most.
- **Find system**: You can get informations about a student (Where he is logged in at, how many times he delogged students and how many times he got delogged).

## Installation

1. **Invite 42Wizard** : Use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1300932692749189235) to invite 42Wizard to your Discord account.
2. **Configure direct messages** : Make sure that you can send messages to the BOT (For the moment, Discord does not automatically create a direct messages channel/send an event when the application is installed for a user. You can execute a 42Wizard command by typing `/` in DMs with one of your friends/other BOTs. You can then go to the 42Wizard profile to open the direct messages channel.).
3. **View commands** : Type `/` to open the commands panel. There is also a `/commands` command.

## Commands
